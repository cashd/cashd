### Hey! My name is Cash üí∏

I'm a software engineer, born and raised in Texas. I specialize in frontend development but have worn many hats ü§† 

I have multiple years of software engineering experience ranging from large tech companies to start ups. I also occasionally take on contract work so feel free to contact me! 0xashd@gmail.com

I code 99% of the time in TypeScript but love functional languages ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Here is my work history:
- Frontend Engineer at [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)
- Software Engineer at [Element Finance](https://delv.tech/) (now Delv)
- Software Engineer at [Twitter](https://x.com/) (now X)
